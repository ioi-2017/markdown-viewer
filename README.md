Markdown Viewer
======================

Markdown-viewer is a simple HTML-based tool for rendering IOI related markdown files including problem statements, editorials, notice, etc.
In addition to standard markdown syntanx, it supports images, headers, footers, and mathematical formula in latex format.


Usage
------------

Just put the HTML file and the `assets` directory besides the markdown file and open the HTML file.
A current limitation is that markdown-viewer only works in Firefox.
The HTML file and the markdown file must have the same name, like `book.md` and `book.html`.
For more information, open `index.md` and `index.html` (in Firefox).
